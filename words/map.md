# The map problem

![Alfred Korzybsky](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Alfred_Korzybski.jpg)

Alfred Korzybsky taught us that we often confuse a map for the
territory it represents. To make better, more informed decisions we
have to narrow the gap between the two as much as possible.

This is especially important in our field of work where we deal with
abstract concepts and can become prisoners of our mental models.
